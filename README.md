# ✈️ Airline Reservation System (Django)

The **Airline Reservation System** is a full-stack web application built with the Django framework and PostgreSQL(via Docker and Flyway migrations).It allows users to search, book, and cancel flight tickets, while administrators can manage flights and monitor all reservations through the Django Admin Panel.

## 🚀 Main Features

### 👤 Users

## ⚙️ How to Run with Docker + PostgreSQL + Flyway
The project includes a fully containerized environment with:
- 🐍 Django (Python 3.11)
- 🐘 PostgreSQL (database)
- 🚀 Flyway (for database schema migrations)

## 🔧 Steps to Start

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonserka/airline-reservation-system-final-.git
cd airline_reservation_django
```

2️⃣ **Build and start all containers**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will:
- Start the PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Automatically apply all Flyway migrations (`/flyway/sql/V1__initial_schema.sql`)
- Launch the Django app on port 8000

3️⃣ **Open in browser**
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

4️⃣ **Access the Django Admin Panel**
Access the Django Admin interface:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Create a superuser (inside the container):
```bash
docker exec -it airline_django python manage.py createsuperuser

```


5️⃣ **Stop containers**
```bash
docker-compose down

```
To remove all data and rebuild from scratch:
```bash
docker-compose down -v --rmi all

```

---

## ⚙️ Default Environment Variables
Defined in docker-compose.yml:
```bash
POSTGRES_USER: airline_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airline_pass
POSTGRES_DB: airline_db

```

---

## 🗄️ Database Migrations
Database structure is version-controlled with Flyway.
All schema definitions are located in:
```bash
flyway/sql/V1__initial_schema.sql

```

## 📦 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python (Django Framework)
- 🐘 PostgreSQL — primary database
- 🚀 Flyway — version-controlled database migrations
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose — containerized environment
- 💻 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🎨 Bootstrap — frontend styling

---

## 🗄️ Database Technology

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database engine, managed through Flyway migrations for schema version control.
All database tables and structures are defined in SQL migration files stored under:
```bash
flyway/sql/
```
When the containers start, Flyway automatically applies any new migrations to keep the database schema up to date.


**Default configuration (docker-compose.yml):**
- Database: airline_db
- User: airline_user
- Password: airline_pass
- Port: 5432

This setup ensures consistent database state across all environments — development, testing, and production.

## 📅 Recent Updates

| Date | Version | Highlights |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **2025-10-25** | v1.0 | Base booking flow, flight search, login/register, ticket issue & cancel (**PLUS only**), seat map, admin CRUD for flights. |
| **2025-10-31** | v1.1 | Multi-passenger booking & seat selection; hide past flights (`date >= today`); new Step 4 (**Extras: luggage/equipment**) and Step 5 (**Payment**); total price includes extras × passengers; `Ticket.purchased_by` for per-user bookings list; **About Ticket** shows extras & PDF with Code128 barcode; session scoping for seats per flight; bugfixes & cleanup. |
| **2025-11-02** | v1.2 | Migrated project to **PostgreSQL** with **Flyway** and **Docker Compose**; added persistent schema migrations; configured `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`; removed old `db.sqlite3`; created superuser inside container; updated `.gitignore` and `README.md` with full Docker setup documentation. |



## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Admin section: List all flights with filter by route (departure Split, arrival Madrid)
- Cancel flight (admin) — delete flight from database
- Check all bought tickets by route 
- sending email to customer who bought ticket
- Admin dashboard with earnings display and statistics (daily/weekly/monthly, top routes, occupancy)
